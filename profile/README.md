This organization contains the source code for *published projects* owned by Rain ([@sunshowers](https://github.com/sunshowers)).

A published project is one that has had releases, usually to some package repository like [crates.io](https://crates.io/), and is generally fit for public use and contributions.

The transition from my personal account is not done yet, but will happen over time.

## Why?

My personal GitHub has a mix of personal and published projects: I'd like to maintain a separation between the two.

In some cases published projects may be moved to organizations of their own; this organization is a catch-all for projects which remain owned by me.

## Sponsoring me

If you or your employer have found any of the projects here useful, I'd deeply appreciate [any kind of sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/sunshowers) you can provide. Thank you ðŸ’™
