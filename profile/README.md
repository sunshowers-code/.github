This organization, at some point in the future, will contain the source code for *published projects* owned by Rain ([@sunshowers](https://github.com/sunshowers)).

A published project is one that has had releases and is generally fit for public consumption.

The transition will happen over time.

## Why?

My personal GitHub has a mix of personal and published projects: I'd like to maintain a separation between the two.

In some cases published projects may be moved to organizations of their own; this organization is a catch-all for projects which remain owned by Rain.
